‎The Absolute Error loss function,‎ $L(\theta,\delta) = ‎\vert‎\delta(x) - \theta‎\vert‎‎‎$,‎ is widely used for Bayes estimation when working with certain types of distributions. The absolute loss imposes a lesser penalty on large deviations than the quadratic loss function, making the Bayes estimator the posterior median,‎ which is not relatively possible to calculate in a closed form for many distributions . Although the postorior distributions in this article do not have a closed form for median, the Bayes estimator for under conjucate and Jefry's prior distribtion can be calculated numerically, when the absolute error loss function is used. This estimator is implemented for ‎$‎‎r<0$ ‎as an Python function. The value of ‎$‎‎\epsilon$‎ is set to $10^{-6}‎$‎ for numerical calculation in the next section. ‎
